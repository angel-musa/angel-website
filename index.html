        <h1>Welcome!</h1>
        <p>I'm Angel Musa, a Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo, with a deep passion for merging technology and finance. My work involves developing cutting-edge tools, from stock data visualization platforms to predictive models, that tackle real-world financial challenges. As I look to the future, I aim to further specialize in quantitative finance and pursue a career as a quant trader, leveraging my technical skills to drive innovative solutions in the financial markets.</p>
        <p>Beyond my professional pursuits, I'm deeply interested in fashion and sustainability. I run a small business where I upcycle clothes for those around me, combining creativity with environmental consciousness. I also love traveling and learning new languagesâ€”I've been learning German for the past six months, and it's been an exciting journey. These passions not only enrich my life but also inspire my work and drive my continuous growth.</p>
